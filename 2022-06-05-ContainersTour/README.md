# Containers

## References

https://github.com/genuinetools/img looks very useful and doesn't require root access / docker group etc... - so it might work nicely on my RHEL server (perhaps with a build environment that is isolated from the main installation).

https://www.giantswarm.io/blog/building-container-images-with-img

https://github.com/containers/buildah has a terrible name, but more tools = more understanding.

https://dev.to/napicella/how-are-docker-images-built-a-look-into-the-linux-overlay-file-systems-and-the-oci-specification-175n looks like a good article about overlayfs

https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec is a useful background reference : note that this is a github spec

** CONCEPT : Have a RTML SPEC ? **
